# Chess ♟️
A chess game, wow! This project is part of [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/).
Made to practice object oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance and constructors. I also learned a lot about handling exceptions and defensive programming.
# Features 🕹
Besides normal chess functionalities, this project also includes special moves like castling, *en passant* and promotion.
